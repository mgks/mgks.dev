# API Reference Overview

This section provides information about the APIs and endpoints available in the mgks.dev project.

## Project Architecture

The mgks.dev website is primarily a static site built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. While it doesn't have a traditional API in the sense of REST endpoints, it does have several key components and data structures that can be considered part of its "API" for customization and extension.

## Key Components

### Jekyll Data Structure

The site uses Jekyll's data structure to manage content:

- **Posts**: Blog posts stored in the `_posts` directory
- **Pages**: Static pages stored in the `_pages` directory
- **Layouts**: Templates in the `_layouts` directory
- **Includes**: Reusable components in the `_includes` directory

### Front Matter

All content files (posts, pages) use YAML front matter to define metadata:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Example Post"
author: author_id
categories: [category1, category2]
tags: [tag1, tag2]
image: path/to/image.jpg
featured: true
---
```

### Configuration

The `_config.yml` file contains all site-wide configuration settings.

## Data Files

Jekyll uses YAML, JSON, or CSV files in the `_data` directory to store structured data:

```
_data/
  ├── authors.yml
  ├── navigation.yml
  └── settings.yml
```

## Liquid Templating

The site uses Liquid templating for dynamic content:

```liquid
{% for post in site.posts %}
  <h2>{{ post.title }}</h2>
  <p>{{ post.excerpt }}</p>
{% endfor %}
```

## Extending the Site

To extend the site, you can:

1. Add new posts in the `_posts` directory
2. Create new layouts in the `_layouts` directory
3. Modify the configuration in `_config.yml`
4. Add new includes in the `_includes` directory
