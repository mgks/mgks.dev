# Quickstart Guide

This guide will help you set up the mgks.dev project locally for development or customization.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) (version 2.5.0 or higher)
- [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download)
- [Bundler](https://bundler.io/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mgks/mgks.dev.git
cd mgks.dev
```

## Install Dependencies

Install the required gems using Bundler:

```bash
bundle install
```

## Run the Jekyll Server

Start the Jekyll server locally:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

This will start a local server, usually at `http://localhost:4000`. Open this URL in your browser to view the website.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Jekyll structure:

- `_config.yml`: Configuration file for Jekyll
- `_layouts/`: Layout templates
- `_includes/`: Reusable components
- `_posts/`: Blog posts in Markdown format
- `_pages/`: Additional pages
- `assets/`: Static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images
- `blog/`: Blog-specific files
- `docs/`: Documentation files (you're looking at them now!)

## Making Changes

1. Make changes to the files as needed
2. Jekyll will automatically regenerate the site when files are changed
3. Refresh your browser to see the changes

## Deployment

The website is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch.
